Prediction using Unsupervised ML

From the given IRIS Dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and present it visually This machine learning project is the benchmark project for any beginner in Machine Learning and usually referred to as the "Hello World". The iris flowers dataset contains numeric attributes. There are 4 features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. K-Means Algorithm is used for determining the optimum number of clusters.

● From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
